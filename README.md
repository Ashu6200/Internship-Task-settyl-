The backend is built with Node.js and Express. The OpenWeather API is used to fetch the weather information for the cities. The data is stored in the MongoDB database and served to the frontend through the API endpoints.

The frontend is built with React and uses the Leaflet.js library for displaying the map. Users can search for the weather information of a specific city by entering the city name in the search bar. The weather information is displayed as a popup on the map when the user clicks on the marker.

The web app is designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly. It uses Bootstrap for styling and layout.

To run the project, clone the repository and run npm install to install the dependencies. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenWeather API key as REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=<your_api_key>. Then, run npm start to start the development server.
